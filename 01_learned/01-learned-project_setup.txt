to generate a new project with rails

  # generates folders and files and install gems needed
  # runs `bundle install` as well

  rails new <project-name> -d <database-support>

  # -d refers to database. rails supports: mysql, postgresql

  # examples:
  rails new simple_cms -d mysql
  rails new bookstore -d postgresql

  # you can see more of what you can do with
  rails new -h

to install gemfiles (if you cloned a rails repo)

  bundle install

to create databases

  to create just current RAILS_ENV environment

    rails db:create

  to create all databases (development, test, production) defined in database.yml

    rails db:create:all

      * seems that to create a production env database you need a role in psql with the same name as the project
