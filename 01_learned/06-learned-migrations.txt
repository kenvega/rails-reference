to run migrations

  rails db:migrate

to rollback the last migration done

  rails db:rollback STEP=1

references and belongs_to are the same (references is an alias)

Rails automatically adds an index to foreign keys when you generate a reference

Note that writing ‘doctor:belongs_to’ is the exact same thing as ‘doctor:references’.

in migrations t.belongs_to and t.references are exactly the same (interchangeable)

  they are defined here
    t.belongs_to - https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/TableDefinition.html#method-i-belongs_to
    t.references - https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/TableDefinition.html#method-i-references

    both point to add_reference docs here - https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/SchemaStatements.html#method-i-add_reference


what can't you do in the migration generator (command line) - https://stackoverflow.com/q/6167994

  you cannot set default values for a column when generating a migration in the command line

    what you usually do is to change the generated migration file before running the migration
      for example add a default value to the column in the migration file before running the migration

    or you could create your own generator to support this

  you cannot make a field required (not nullable) - https://stackoverflow.com/a/22661731

    you will also need to change the migration after creating it
