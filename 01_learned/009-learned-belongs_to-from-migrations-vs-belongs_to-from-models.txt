there are migrations that use belongs_to

  t.belongs_to :author, foreign_key: true, index: true

and there are models that use belongs_to too

  class Book < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :author
  end

how to know where the 'belongs_to' methods come from?
  Currently the only way I know to see where they come from is using RubyMine and hovering over their method names
    that tells you exactly where the method comes from

what is the difference between those uses of belongs_to?

  for the belongs_to in the models that is used for associations

    it comes from ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods

    https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-belongs_to

  for the belongs_to that is used in migrations

    it comes from ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::TableDefinition

    https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/TableDefinition.html#method-i-belongs_to

      this refers to other part of the doc

        https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/SchemaStatements.html#method-i-add_reference
