there are migrations that use belongs_to

  t.belongs_to :author, foreign_key: true, index: true

and there are models that use belongs_to too

  class Book < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :author
  end

what is the difference between them? how to know from where those methods are running

  for the belongs_to in the models that is used for associations

    it comes from ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods

    https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-belongs_to

  for the belongs_to that is used in migrations

    it comes from ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::TableDefinition

    https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/TableDefinition.html#method-i-belongs_to

      this refers to other part of the doc

        https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/SchemaStatements.html#method-i-add_reference

  how to know where this methods comes from?
    I knew because I was using RubyMine. Currently I have no other way to know where they come from
