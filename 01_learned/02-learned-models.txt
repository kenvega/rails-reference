to generate models

  # create one model with multiple attributes in one command
  rails generate model <Model-name> <attribute>:<datatype>

  # example
  rails generate model User name:string email:string


  this for now only create some files in your codebase

    files for the models and files for migrations are created

    no change in database yet is made (at least that seems to happen)
      changes in database occur once you run migrations
